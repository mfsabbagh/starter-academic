title: CSHL Blood-Brain Barrier Meeting
abstract: Vascular endothelial cell (EC) function depends on appropriate
  organ-specific molecular and cellular specializations. To explore genomic
  mechanisms that control this specialization, we have analyzed and compared the
  transcriptome, accessible chromatin, and DNA methylome landscapes from mouse
  brain, liver, lung, and kidney ECs. Analysis of transcription factor (TF) gene
  expression and TF motifs at candidate cis- regulatory elements reveals both
  shared and organ-specific EC regulatory networks. In the embryo, only those
  ECs that are adjacent to or within the central nervous system (CNS) exhibit
  canonical Wnt signaling, which correlates precisely with blood-brain barrier
  (BBB) differentiation and Zic3 expression. In the early postnatal brain,
  single-cell RNA-seq of purified ECs reveals (1) close relationships between
  veins and mitotic cells and between arteries and tip cells, (2) a division of
  capillary ECs into vein-like and artery-like classes, and (3) new endothelial
  subtype markers, including new validated tip cell markers.
