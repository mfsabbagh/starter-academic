At the time of this writing, Brood X cicada nymphs are beginning their journey to the surface of the eastern United States after an extended slumber underground. Belonging to the genus *Magicicada*, this particular brood of periodical cicadas greets us for a few weeks to live out their adult lives, only to die and never be seen again for another 17 years. Their abrupt disappearance along with the abundant sensory experience associated with their emergence--sightings of desiccated husks of what once was clinging to trees, the chorus of courtship song in the early evening, the sticky, humid air of the months when they appear--serves as a mnemonic timestamp on our own identities. Sure, we still get the cicada experience every year due to the annual variety of the insect as well as the staggered emergence of different periodic broods. However, the massive emergence of Brood X leads to an imprint on the collective memory, a "phenomenon" discussed among many. In a sense, this behavior endows these insects with an extended reach of time travel on humans, forcing us to take a moment to reflect on how things were and how things have changed over a 17-year period.

So what do cicadas have to do with HBO's *The Wire*, a show exploring the intersection of police, politics, and the citizens of Baltimore, Maryland? After living nearly ten years in Baltimore, I managed to watch only the inaugural season of this show.
