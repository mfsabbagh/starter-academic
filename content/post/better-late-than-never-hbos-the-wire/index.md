At the time of this writing, Brood X cicada nymphs are beginning their journey to the surface of the eastern United States after an extended slumber underground. Belonging to the genus *Magicicada*, this particular brood of periodical cicadas greets us for a few weeks to live out their adult lives, only to die and never be seen again for another 17 years. Their abrupt disappearance along with the abundant sensory experience associated with their emergence--sightings of desiccated husks of what once was clinging to trees, the deafening chorus of courtship song, the sticky, humid air of the months when they appear--serves as a mnemonic timestamp on our own identities. Sure, we still get the cicada experience every year due to the annual variety of the insect as well as the staggered emergence of different periodic broods. However, the massive emergence of Brood X leads to an imprint on the collective memory, a "phenomenon" discussed among many. In a sense, this behavior endows these insects with an extended reach of time travel on humans, forcing us to take a moment to reflect on how things were and how things have changed over a 17-year period.

So what do cicadas have to do with HBO's *The Wire*, a show exploring the intersection of police, politics, crime, and citizens of Baltimore, Maryland? After living nearly ten years in Baltimore, I managed to watch only the inaugural season of this show. I recall thinking that it arguably exhibited the best storytelling of all time, however I got caught up with my training that I failed to continue watching. Now, with downtime between graduating and moving to Boston to begin residency training, I decided to revisit the series. The show is more than drama, more than a compelling narrative with incredible character arcs. It is an education in humanity, dysfunction in a major American city, and the resulting ugly racial disparities.

Enter cicadas. To my surprise, in Season 3, homicide detective Bunk Moreland drops the following line: "I guarantee they won't breathe a free breath until the cicadas come back." I had to pause the episode. The last time Brood X emerged was 2004. *This show is from 2004?!* My shock at when this season was produced revolves around how progressive and prescient this series was. For example, a major plot point in season 3 involves harm reduction and decriminalization of drugs, clearly successful interventions in 2021 but most likely taboo polices in the early 2000s during the failing War on Drugs. Season 2, which focuses on dockworkers, highlights the impending loss of jobs due to automation. Even more shocking to me is that this show never won an Emmy award. Perhaps I may have just been too young at the time to appreciate the emergence of *The Wire*, but it almost feels as if, unlike Brood X or HBO's *Game of Thrones*, it failed to captivate the collective memory. As is often said of great shows, one explanation for this failure to captivate, may just be that *The Wire* was ahead of its time. 

However, like Brood X's ability to make us time travel, watching *The Wire* in 2021, one realizes how much the city of Baltimore has changed over 17 years and, more importantly, how much of the past echoes in the present. From scenery alone, recognizing familiar neighborhoods in the show, gentrification comes alive. There are still the familiar vacant, boarded-up houses. During my time in the city, I saw corrupt political figures resign and unrest develop due to injustice carried out by the police. 

Baltimore is a city with its fair share of issues. But it's a city of grit and charm. In a strange way, it is the first city that I lived in that felt like home. I'll certainly miss Baltimore, and watching *The Wire* has been a great send off. In ten years, I barely scratched the surface of understanding the rich history of this city. I can only hope that
