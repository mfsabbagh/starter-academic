I am currently a pathology resident at MGH. I am generally interested in understanding how the molecules produced by our cells impact human development, health, and disease. I have a broad set of research interests ranging from exploring mechanisms of endothelial cell plasticity as a model for vertebrate gene regulation and cell identity to treating diseases of the brain and eye by manipulating gene expression at the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers to anti-phage defense systems in bacteria.

I earned my ScB in Neuroscience at Brown University where I worked with [Eric Morrow](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/emmorrow#). I pursued combined MD-PhD training in the [Medical Scientist Training Program](https://mdphd.johnshopkins.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine where I completed my doctoral research with [Jeremy Nathans](http://nathanslab.mbg.jhmi.edu/). Leveraging next-generation sequencing-based assays, I generated a broad catalogue of gene regulatory features across early postnatal vascular endothelium of the brain, liver, lung, and kidney from the mouse. Following the development of this important dataset, I focused my research to explore the role of beta-catenin/Wnt signaling in blood-brain barrier development and maintenance. You can explore this data at the [Vascular Endothelial Cell Trans-omics Resource Database](https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/).

During my final two years of medical school, I collaborated with [Joshua Modell](https://www.modelllab.com/) to gain exposure to microbial genomics. I worked to identify novel roles for bacterial CRISPR/Cas systems in addition to prokaryotic immunity and to search for novel anti-CRISPR proteins.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy spending time with my wife and dog and watching dark comedies.
