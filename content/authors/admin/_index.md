I am a pathology resident at MGH. I am generally interested in understanding how the molecules produced by our cells impact human development, health, and disease. I have a broad set of research interests that include  exploring mechanisms of endothelial cell plasticity as a model for vertebrate gene regulation and cell identity, treating diseases of the brain and eye by manipulating gene expression at the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers, anti-phage defense systems in bacteria, and the role of symbiosis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution.

I earned my ScB in Neuroscience at Brown where I worked with [Eric Morrow](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/emmorrow#). I pursued combined MD-PhD training in the [Medical Scientist Training Program](https://mdphd.johnshopkins.edu/) at Johns Hopkins where I completed my doctoral research with [Jeremy Nathans](http://nathanslab.mbg.jhmi.edu/). Using next-generation sequencing-based assays, I generated a broad catalogue of gene regulatory features across early postnatal vascular endothelium of the brain, liver, lung, and kidney from the mouse. I then focused on the role of beta-catenin/Wnt signaling in blood-brain barrier development and maintenance. You can explore this data at the [Vascular Endothelial Cell Trans-omics Resource Database](https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/).

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy watching dark comedies and spending time with my wife and dog.
